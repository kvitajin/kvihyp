def launch_spice_viewer(self):
    """
    Launches the SPICE viewer for a virtual machine using a temporary configuration file.

    This method generates a temporary SPICE configuration file (`/tmp/vm_spice.vv`) with the connection
    details stored in `self.spice_config`. It then launches the SPICE viewer (`remote-viewer`) with this
    configuration file as an argument, allowing the user to connect to the VM's graphical console.

    The `self.spice_config` dictionary is expected to contain key-value pairs representing SPICE connection
    parameters (e.g., host, port, password).

    Note:
        - The SPICE viewer application (`remote-viewer`) must be installed on the system for this method to work.
        - This method assumes the SPICE configuration is already populated in `self.spice_config`.
